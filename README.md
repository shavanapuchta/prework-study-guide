# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

There is a lot of study material dispersed in different locations. I would like a consolidated place to access all study materials for the coding bootcamp. I do not have to search through different systems and webpages to find relevant information. I learned the different languages used to build a webpage -- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned that HTML relates to the structure, CSS relates to the style, and JavaScript relates to the interactivity of a webpage.
